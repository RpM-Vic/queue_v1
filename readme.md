I want to create an script that will automatically make a push to a remote repository twice a day.
I also want to crate a queue in a json file that will contatin the date
of the latest pushes.

I wonder if it is good idea if I create a local database instead of a json file?

This is the name of the task in the task wizard:
Autopush

autopush didn't work
